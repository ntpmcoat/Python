    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval and management of data.\n",
    "It serves as a central repository for storing, managing, and manipulating information.\n",
    "Databases can be relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) based on their data model and storage mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "********** Difference b/w SQL and NoSQL********\n",
    "Data Model:\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model, while NoSQL databases use various non-relational data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema:\n",
    "SQL databases have a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases are schema-less or have flexible schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often more scalable and suitable for handling large datasets and distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: \n",
    "SQL databases use SQL for querying, whereas NoSQL databases may have their query languages, APIs, or use simple key-value access."
