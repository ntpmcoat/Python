    "    - Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, providing insights into its central tendencies, dispersion, and shape.\n",

    "    - Example: A pharmaceutical company wants to determine the effectiveness of a new drug for a specific medical condition. They conduct a clinical trial with a sample of patients and measure the improvement in their symptoms. By applying inferential statistics, they can estimate the likelihood that the observed improvements in the sample are representative of what would happen if the drug were given to the entire population of patients with that medical condition."

Descriptive statistics for this dataset would include calculating the mean (average) age (20 years), the median (middle value) age (20 years), and the standard deviation (a measure of how much the  ages vary from the mean).\n",

    "- Example: Imagine you want to estimate the average height of all students in a school using a sample of 50 students. You calculate the average  height of the sample and then use inferential statistics to estimate the range within which the average height of the entire school's student population likely falls. This estimation involves measures like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.\n"
