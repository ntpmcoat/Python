    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "=>Multiprocessing in Python refers to the capability of a program to utilize multiple processes to perform tasks concurrently.\n",
    "=>It allows you to create and manage multiple processes, each running independently and executing its own task.\n",
    "=>The multiprocessing module in Python provides tools for working with multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Usefulness of Multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "=>Improved Performance: Multiprocessing can significantly speed up CPU-bound tasks by leveraging multiple CPU cores to perform computations simultaneously.\n",
    "=>True Parallelism: Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing allows for true parallelism in Python, as each process has its own Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and runs in separate memory spaces.\n",
    "=>Better Resource Utilization: By distributing tasks across multiple processes, multiprocessing makes efficient use of available system resources.\n",
    "=>Allows Task Distribution: It enables dividing large tasks into smaller sub-tasks and processing them concurrently, achieving task parallelism."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "********* Nature of Execution: ********\n",
    "Multiprocessing runs multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space and GIL whereas Multithreading runs multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space and GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*******Communication and Isolation:*****\n",
    "Multiprocessing requires explicit communication mechanisms like pipes or queues, and processes are isolated from each other whereas In Multithreading Threads can easily communicate through shared variables, but proper synchronization is necessary to avoid race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "********* Memory Overhead ***************\n",
    "In Multiprocessing, higher memory overhead as each process has its own memory space whereas in Multithreading, lower memory overhead as threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*********Parallelism: ********\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Achieves true parallelism since each process can run independently on separate CPU cores.\n",
    "Multithreading: Limited parallelism due to the GIL, which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time."
