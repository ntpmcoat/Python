    "# Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites automatically.\n",
    "- It involves using software or scripts to retrieve and parse the HTML code of web pages, extract the desired information, and save it in a structured format like a spreadsheet or database. \n",
    "- Web scraping allows users to gather large amounts of data from multiple websites efficiently and in a relatively short period of time.\n",
    "- Web scraping is used for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Data Collection and Analysis: Web scraping enables businesses and researchers to gather data from various online sources for analysis and decision-making. It can be used to collect market data, customer reviews, product details, pricing information, social media data, and more.\n",
    "    2. Research and Monitoring: Web scraping is extensively used in academic research, particularly in social sciences and data-driven fields. \n",
    "    3. Aggregation and Content Creation: Web scraping can automate the process of gathering content from different websites to creat"

    "# Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Manual Copy-Pasting \n",
    "    The simplest form of web scraping involves manually copying and pasting data from a website into a spreadsheet or text file. This method is suitable for small-scale data extraction tasks that do not require automation or frequent updates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.Regular Expression Matching\n",
    "    Regular expressions (regex) are powerful pattern-matching tools used to extract specific data from web pages. By defining patterns and rules, regex can search through the HTML code and capture the desired information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.HTML Parsing\n",
    "    HTML parsing involves using programming libraries or frameworks that can parse HTML documents and extract data from specific tags or elements. Libraries such as BeautifulSoup (Python) and Jsoup (Java) provide convenient methods to navigate the HTML structure, locate desired elements, and extract their contents. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 4.Web Scraping Tools and Frameworks\n",
    "    There are specialized web scraping tools and frameworks that simplify the process of data extraction. These tools often offer a graphical interface and allow users to define scraping tasks by selecting elements on a web page visually. \n",

    "#### Web Application Development:\n",
    "   - Flask allows you to develop web applications quickly and easily.\n",
    "   - In the context of web scraping, Flask can be used to create a user interface where users can interact with the scraping functionality. \n",
    "   - It provides routing capabilities, template rendering, and request handling, making it convenient to build a web interface for initiating and managing the web scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Interaction and Input:\n",
    "   - Flask enables the creation of forms and input fields, which can be utilized to take user inputs such as URLs, search queries, or scraping parameters. \n",
    "   - This allows users to customize and control the scraping process, specifying the data they want to extract, the websites to scrape, or any other relevant options. \n",
